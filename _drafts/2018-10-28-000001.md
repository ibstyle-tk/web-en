Hello everyone! I came up with an idea of introducing study tips of IB subjects (both MYP and DP) because many younger students who is also taking IB asked me how to tackle to each subject. 

Part 1 is group 5, **Mathematics for MYP and DP!**

I have heard a lot of people say **“I hate math”** or **“I am bad at math”** in both Japan and Canada, so math is assumed as **one of the most disliked classes** in your country as well.

Why Math is not that popular? I am taking math HL and everyone thinks I can’t understand their struggles. That’s totally wrong because I used to be bad at math when I was in elementary school. 

I think a reason why math is the most disliked subject is that **most units in math are hard to imagine how it is used in real life** and it is very **complex** even if you can think of. Some people like calculations though they don’t like math since calculations are simple and we usually use it in the various aspects (Actually this case was me in grade 6).

Anyway, I think many students need help for this subject. That’s why I chose to introduce math study tips first of all.

Here is what I recommend to you when you study math;

- **Draw/sketch a graph or diagram (Especially for sentence questions!)**
- **Review your quiz/test three times**
- **Use notebooks (Theory, exercise, and mistakes)**

# Graph / Diagram

I feel that IB likes to make us draw or sketch a graph/diagram in both sciences and math. In fact, “draw” and “sketch” are IB command terms. Also, in my opinion, many people tend to make a mistake when they try to solve the sentence question although they could get what the unit is about and formulas, or they can do simple calculations. I think this is because they didn’t get where the number in the sentence should be used in. In this case, graph and diagram are very helpful to understand what the question is asking as **thoughts in your brain are organized by drawing or sketching them**, so you can figure out how to use each number in the question.

_Numbers appearing in the question are clues and formulas are tools you have. It is like a mystery novel... isn’t it?_

# Review

The second one is **review quiz and test after those are back for finding out why it is wrong** and **where you tend to make mistakes** as those are assessed for measuring how much you understand the unit. In other words, if you made mistakes you have something not clearly understand. **Look at where you answered wrong **and** try again until you can solve it without using textbooks or notes from the class**. It takes a while to be able to cypher the question and you might memorize the way to solve it. The cycle of review depends on you but I recommend **three times** at least; **right after those are returned, one week later and one month later**. It is because prevent memorizing the question and its answer. I can tell that you will forget review after one month (even one week later) as I kept forgetting about it. To prevent an oblivescence, I made a notebook called “Mistake notebook” which I explained next.

# Notebooks

When I was in grade 7 and attended for the first IB math class, my teacher told us that bring two notebooks. One of them is for “theory” and another is for “exercise”. **Notes from the class or things your teacher wrote on the board** like example questions and proofs **are on “theory” notebook**, and **questions from the textbook are worked on “exercise”**. I think it was good because the notebook ran out quickly if theory and exercise are together on one notebook. Also, notes from the class are hard to find when you looked back the notebook. In addition, you can see on the photo below, **“mistake notebook”** which I mentioned made me **easy to look up after** and **was helpful not to forget to review**. I wrote the date of quiz/test and when I reviewed first and I took it off when I finished the review. I am using line notebooks but it actually depends on you. I felt unfigured notebook like sketchbook was also good when I drew graphs/diagrams. **Use stationery that is suitable and motivate you**.

I picked up three tips at this time but the crucial thing in math is challenge as many questions as possible for getting used to solving the question. There is another article focusing on DP Math SL/HL. I hope it will be helpful for you!
