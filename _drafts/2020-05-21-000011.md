Dear readers of IB Style,

Hello, I am Heyo from IB Style.

Today, I would like to apologise for my article “DP French ab initio SL” (published in 2019 June) since it contained inaccurate information related to the IB curriculum. I published inaccurate information on the section under “Internal Assessment” from the article. I also typed ‘written assessment’ instead of ‘written assignment.’ I lacked understanding of the IB curriculum.

I asked the editorial department of IB Style to delete my posts, both in Japanese and English. From now on, I will make sure to take responsibility in publishing the correct information. 

Please continue to give support to IB Style,

Heyo
