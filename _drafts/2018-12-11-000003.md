This time is about Chemistry SL and HL for DP students! In this course, we struggle with not only calculations but also memorizations of concepts so it is bit different from math. 

In sciences, there is always “cause and result” and this is a reason why I like sciences and math. Understanding “cause and result” is the first step to get higher mark in chemistry as the course requires focusing on the relationship between cause and result much more than other sciences and math (maybe physics needs as well).

Here is a list of the most important units over 2 years;

1. **Measurement**: Uncertainty and sig fig are crucial in the experiment and calculations.
1. **Atomic theory**: Electron configuration and orbital are necessary to know when you think physical and chemical properties of elements and molecules.
1. **Periodicity**: This is basically about the periodic table like how elements locate on the table. It is useful when you write IA.
1. **Bonding**: It focuses on shapes of molecules and intermolecular and intramolecular force.
1. **Moles**: It deals with units and is foundation of all other calculations in chemistry.
1. **Organic**: All organic compounds are from this units. You should remember all types of organic compounds.

Although it depends on schools’ curriculums, I think these units are taught in grade 11. It means how much you remember from grade 11 influences your final IB mark. 
However, it is very hard to memorize all of things at the same time. In particular, we are all nervous during exams and it will be difficult to remember all.
