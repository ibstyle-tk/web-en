*Disclaimer: This article is written by the author who finished taking IB exams in May 2019. I have no prior knowledge or exact information on what the new ab initio course/curriculum would look like. Therefore, I cannot be responsible if there was any mistake/errors in the comments I made about the upcoming External Assessment for French ab initio, 2020 First Assessment. Please check the official IBO website for the correct and the updated information.* 

Hello! My name is Heyo.
Today, I would like to introduce you about how I studied for IBDP French ab initio SL of Group 2 Language Acquisition. 

First of all, I would like to explain about what Group 2 Language Acquisition means. For Group 2 subject, there are two major options to consider: Language ab initio SL and Language B. (I am not going to talk about Classical Languages since this course was not offered in my school).
Language ab initio is mainly designed for those who learn the language of their choice for the first time in their life. According to IBO official website, it is explained that: 

“Language ab initio courses are for beginners (that is, students who have little or no previous experience of learning the language they have chosen). These courses are only available at standard level” (“Language Acquisition”).

The difference between Language B and Language ab initio is: 

“Language B courses are intended for students who have had some previous experience of learning the language. They may be studied at either higher level or standard level.” (“Language Acquisition”).

This is only my personal impression but those who took French B around me were majorly francophone speakers who had prior experiences in studying at French school or those who talk with their family members in French. 

Although I studied French for two years at a beginner level before enrolling in DP, I decided to take French ab initio SL after hearing my teacher’s advice and suggestions. In Language B, it is required to have an established ability to read, write and talk because sometimes you may have to read a French literature. 

It highly depends upon the teacher/school’s decision and the student’s motivation to make a decision between ab initio and Language B. 

Now, I would like to finish my long intro, and start writing about my personal experiences and opinions on tackling French ab initio SL.

I am going to introduce the 2020 First Assessment Subject Brief from IBO website. The syllabus for French ab initio got changed for those who enter IB after 2019. 

*It is absolutely crucial to confirm and check the latest syllabus/subject brief from the official IB website due to frequent curriculum changes. 


## 2020 First Assessment Course Outline

The course outline has changed a lot since I took my French abinitio course from August 2017 to May 2019. There is no section for Written Assessment in Internal Assessment. Paper 1 became specifically designed for reading while Paper 2 became designed for listening and reading for the 2020 first assessment. For May 2019 examination session, Paper 1 was on reading while Paper 2 was structured for writing. 

These changes in curriculum and syllabus often lead to students’ frustrations and confusions. Being adapted to IB info is crucial in tackling Diploma Programme.

For my studying tips, I made sure that I took my notes during class carefully while I used textbooks and online dictionary to look up and revise some words that I didn’t know. 

I personally took French ab initio as an enjoyable class. I listened to French songs during the class to fill up the lyrics of the song. I also read French magazines for teenagers and watched French movies to expand my vocabularies in French. 

In the next section, I will write about how I prepared for the final exams. 


## Preparation for final exam (External Assessment)

Writing
For me, it was important to memorise the format of the types of writing (e.g. letter to friends, email, article and so on) for preparing Paper 2 (reminder: the course curriculum will change for 2020 first assessment. It seems that the new Paper 2 will be solely dedicated for listening and reading).

I basically prepared for exams by writing practice responses that my French teacher handed to me. I mostly wrote around 50 to 100 words in French, and repeated practicing. 
However, make sure to get a thorough feedback from your French teacher on your writing. I cannot stop emphasising the importance of identifying and understanding your grammatical errors. 

Reading
The course curriculum that I took structured Paper 1 to be solely dedicated on reading (reminder: course curriculum will change for 2020 first assessment. The new Paper 1 will be for writing, and Paper 2 will be both on listening and reading). To get used to the French articles and long text, I made sure that I solved enough past papers during class, and at home. 

The most crucial elements in preparing for exam would be to ask your French teacher whenever you feel like you didn’t understand something. It is really essential to have a fluent communication with your French teacher because there are several nuances and problems that require the students to understand French culture. 

Because I don’t have any knowledge in the new listening section that was added to the new Paper 2, I cannot comment upon the preparation for exam. Nonetheless, it matters on the teacher’s capability to adapt to the new IB syllabus in order for students to mark a high score:))


## Internal Assessment

I don’t think any one who took IB or who is involved in IB can explain the system of Internal Assessment very clearly. To explain it briefly, it is called “Internal” because teachers in your school will give you a score on your submitted IB assessment. On the other hand, IB will evaluate the scores that the teachers has assigned for submitted IB assessment by random. Yes, it is really complicated...

My French IA required me to prepare for Written Assessment and Interactive Oral but it seems that the new curriculum starting as 2020 First Assessment only asks for Interactive Oral. 

I don’t know the system of new Interactive Oral. Nevertheless, speaking from my own experiences, the best tips to prepare for oral exams is to focus on practice. I was really hesitant in speaking in French, so I made sure to make appointments with my French teacher during break time, after school and before school to do 1-on-1 practices. My classmates who were able to hire some French teachers practiced with their tutors. The Interactive Oral prior to 2020 First Assessment evaluated the range of vocabularies, the student’s engagement and the fluency of the conversation. It is hard to notice your grammatical errors. Therefore, I recorded my oral practices at home and send the file to my French teacher to receive the feedbacks.  


## Some other study tips:)

Duolingo

I assume many of you already know about this, but there is a website called “Duolingo” which allows you to do mini language exercises on a day to day basis (“What is Duolingo?”). I was able to increase my vocabularies by using this website. You can decide and set a goal for yourself to do Duolingo for 20 mins per day or 30 mins per week depending on your French ability. You can make an account from here ([https://www.duolingo.com/](https://www.duolingo.com/)) or you can download the app on your phone since you can also get this from Apple Store and Google Play.
