This time is about Chemistry SL and HL for DP students! In this course, we struggle with not only calculations but also memorizations of concepts, so it is bit different from math. 

In sciences, there is always “cause and result” and this is a reason why I like sciences and math. Understanding “cause and result” is the first step to get higher mark in chemistry as the course requires focusing on the relationship between cause and result much more than other sciences and math (maybe physics needs as well).

Here is a list of the most important units over 2 years;

1. **Measurement**: Uncertainty and sig fig are crucial in the experiment and calculations.
1. **Atomic theory**: Electron configuration and orbital are necessary to know when you think physical and chemical properties of elements and molecules.
1. **Periodicity**: This is basically about the periodic table like how elements locate on the table. It is useful when you write IA.
1. **Bonding**: It focuses on shapes of molecules and intermolecular and intramolecular force.
1. **Moles**: It deals with units and is foundation of all other calculations in chemistry.
1. **Organic**: All organic compounds are from this units. You should remember all types of organic compounds.

Although it depends on schools’ curriculums, I think these units are taught in grade 11. It means how much you remember from grade 11 influences your final IB mark. 
However, it is very hard to memorize all of things at the same time. In particular, we are all nervous during exams and it will be difficult to remember all.

_I have my hands full with memorizing only this, how can I remember all other stuffs??_

I would like to let you know devised ways to study. One of ways is typical; make flashcards or notes. It is important to challenge many questions/exercises to memorize completely without looking references. Textbook is essential to rise your total mark, you need to read in detail and carefully.

Although Option unit for HL is different depending on each school, it will be definitely on the exam. HL students must review before the exam.

Chemistry IA is the maximum 12 pages. There are two types; Experimental and Theoretical IA. If you choose Experimental IA, I recommend to decide your topic and research question as fast as possible since you may need to buy materials for the experiment.

Full mark is 24 marks and 50% of IA are Evaluation and Exploration (6 marks each). 

**Exploration**: The student requires to establish the scientific context for the work, state a clear and focused research question and use concepts and take into account of safety, environmental, and ethical considerations.

**Evaluation**: The report provides evidence of evaluation of the investigation and the results with regard to the research question and the accepted scientific context. It is necessary to describe and justify a conclusion, identify weaknesses in the procedure and suggest improvements.[^1]

Its structure can be divided into introduction, methodology, data & analysis, conclusion and evaluation, so it had better to start from methodology to reach to evaluation earlier. I recommend making outline for the IA after you decide your research question.

Chemistry is applied into our daily life. When you are wondering about something related to chemistry, you should do some research since it could be your IA topic and acquire knowledge from the class.
