Hello, everyone! 
In this article, I would like to talk about how to survive “IB”.

When you are doing an **IB DP** (Diploma Program) or **MYP** (Middle Years Program), one of the most essential skills you need in order to survive these IB programs is to know how to cope with stress.

**So… what is stress anyways?**

According to the cambridge dictionary it says: stress is a great worry caused by difficult situation, or something that causes this condition: sleeping difficulties, minor pains, headaches.[^1]

BUT for IB students, stress means more than that.

IB version of stress…
* a great fear of failing 
* SO MUCH THINGS TO DO
* but in the end you procrastinate
* no time to get any work done
* 24 hours isn’t enough
* regret
* why did I choose IB
* no social life
* no having fun
* the distance between you and your family because you always in your room studying
* I hate my life…
* what if I don’t get accepted into any university
* and so on… it goes on and on...

I am very sure many IB students are going through these issues and crying( just like what I do every sunday)

But try to think more in a positive way. In my opinion, I think IB is trying to teach us how to cope with stress in the future by letting students experience stress at a young age so you won’t come into piece when your in university.

**[Caution!!]** I am not a professional in coping with stress caused by IB, and the different ways of relieving stress that I will be introducing does not 100% guarantee that it works for all the IB students. These methods came from my personal experience!

# Method 1: Talk, speak, and consult

whatever you are stressed about… **Talk to someone!!**

I’m sure you have friends you can talk to about IB and how stressful it is but at the end you and your friends can encourage each other to overcome the wall of IB program. It does not have to be about IB, you can talk about other things! Just have a conversation about anything!  I am sure your friends will make you laugh and that is what you need! Personally, I think laughing is the best way to relieve stress.

Friends get you the most but I am sure teachers and parents are there for you too!

Teachers are professionals in what they are doing so if you are feeling stressed by the loads of work or if you don’t understand what you are being taught, talking to that subject’s teacher about how you are feeling then I am sure your teacher will solve your problems with you!! Just try! It worked for me! It was so much better for me to talk to the teachers than just keeping all the stress in myself!

# Method 2: Have fun!

On weekends I used to lock myself in my room to get works done but that's not good for you. So I started to walk during the weekends. One of the benefits of living in Canada is that we get clean and fresh air. As I walk, I try to take a deep breath. It makes me calm and at the end of the walk, I feel recharged and I can start working hard again for my goal of getting into my dream university.

Also, I live near the beach and where I live is surrounded by lots of nature. So just by looking at the beautiful scenery relaxes me and I can relieve stress very easily.

I hope this helped! I will continue writing methods of relieving IB stress based on my experiences!
